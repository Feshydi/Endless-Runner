# Endless-Runner
 
Endless Runner is a computer game that puts players in the middle of a never-ending battle against waves of mobs.
With three characters to choose from, each equipped with their own special weapon and skill.
Players will have to stay on their toes if they want to survive.

P.S. In the process of creating the game, were studied new solutions to improve the code and partially applied.
However, I decided not to rewrite the old code so as not to delay the project.
